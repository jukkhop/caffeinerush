Hi. I almost never write about any of my personal things on the internet,
but sometimes I feel like I want to write some stuff down. This blog is
mainly an experiment to scratch that itch. Also, it seemed like a good
opportunity to try and learn Gatsby.

This blog exists merely for my own amusement. I'm not expecting anyone to
read it, but I've decided to put it out there nonetheless.

## So, who the eff are you?

Pretty much exactly a nobody. I have no significant contributions or
achievements to my name (still working on that ðŸ˜‰).

I work as a professional software developer, currently employed by a Finnish
company. I am in the fortunate position of being paid to do what I love.

Age-wise I'm in my late twenties, just about to hit the thirty mark.

What else.. ðŸ¤”

I have a certain fascination towards everything computing (surprise there).
Other stuff that I enjoy very much:

- Cats
- Coffee
- Gaming
- Physics (mostly astro and quantum stuff)
- Scifi
- Trance music

Don't want to reveal too much about myself just now. I might put some stuff
here that I don't want people come and confront me about in person.

I'll most likely write about the aforementioned things, but I'm not going to
strictly keep to any category. I'll write about whatever I feel like.
